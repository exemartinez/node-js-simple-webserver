# node-js-simple-webserver

This is just a simple web server that intends to aid the programmers to start with node-js in a simple way.
Of course, there could be better and more complete servers. I'm intending to initiate this project for learning purposes. If anyone is willing to participate or to use this work, please, feel free to do it.
